_original gateway||gangsta lambda executable_

an og static site generator that utilizes AWS api gateway + lambda + dynamodb


using [surfeit](https://github.com/yyolk/surfeit) ogle can also show the site at any point in time; if the time span is _reasonably popular_ that is also cached through ogle mechanics to provide best performance
